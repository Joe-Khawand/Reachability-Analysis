# Reachability-Analysis

The goal of this project is to implement a bounded horizon Taylor expansion based reachability analysis for non-linear continuous systems.
We've chosen to implement this method in python using **sympy** for the symbolic calculations, **numpy** for numerical applications, **pyinterval** for interval arithmetic, and finally **matplotlib** for plotting the results.
